# Audit Report — lets-play

Date: 2025-10-14

Summary
-------
This short audit documents the recent API normalization and related verification steps performed on the project.

What I changed (professional standardization)
- Normalized authorization failure handling: operations where the caller is authenticated but forbidden to act now return HTTP 403 (Forbidden).
  - Added `com.example.lets_play.exception.ForbiddenException` annotated with `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)`.
  - Replaced service-layer throws of `BadRequestException` for ownership checks with `ForbiddenException` in `ProductService`.
- Kept unauthorized (not authenticated) behavior as 401 and handled by `AuthEntryPointJwt`.

Tests added
- `src/test/java/com/example/lets_play/ForbiddenIntegrationTest.java`
  - End-to-end integration test that creates two users, creates a product as user A, and verifies that user B receives 403 when attempting to update user A's product.
  - Uses SpringBootTest with random port and `TestRestTemplate`-style calls.

Verification
- Ran `mvn test` — all tests passed locally (2 tests, 0 failures). The integration test asserts the 403 behavior.
- Manual API audit steps done earlier (signup, signin, product CRUD, rate limiting, sensitive-data checks) remain valid after the change.

Notes and recommendations
- Prefer throwing `ForbiddenException` (403) for permission issues originating from business logic. Reserve `BadRequestException` (400) for client-side validation errors or malformed requests.
- Consider adding focused integration tests for other access control paths (delete, admin override).
- Once approved, commit and push this audit along with the code changes so project history documents the standardization.
